# Enhancing Tech Creation through Multimodal Context - Report

This repository contains a technical report for the JetBrains Research internship proposal: **"Enhancing Tech Creation through Multimodal Context."**

The project explores how eye-tracking can be integrated into an XR (Extended Reality) environment to enhance tech creation workflows across the following domains:

- Software Development  
- Hardware Engineering  
- UI/UX Design  
- Data Science  

## Overview

The report includes:

- Research-backed motivations and use cases for using eye-tracking in XR
- A proposed prototype system architecture
- Technology stack and role of each discipline in the build process
- Implementation concepts for gaze-based interaction, AI-enhanced suggestion, and multimodal workflows
